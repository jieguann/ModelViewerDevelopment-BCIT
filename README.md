## Test Description
1. A MeshCollider is added to each of them for the single model part interaction to enable mouse interaction. Use OnMouseOver() to change the colour of a single part when the mouse icon hovers on it.
2. Get the mouse position and detect the click of the middle or right button of the mouse to move or rotate the model.
3. A pivot object is created, and its position is set to the center of the single model. Set the pivot of the parent of the single model part for the drag interaction since the original position of the single model is not match the ideal pivot position, which will affect the mouse drag interaction.
